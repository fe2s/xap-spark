# Introduction #

Real-time processing is becoming more and more popular. Spark Streaming is an extension of the core Spark API that allows scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams.
Spark Streaming has many use cases: user activity analytics on web, recommendation systems, censor data analytics, fraud detection, sentiment analytics and many more.
Data can be ingested to Spark cluster from many sources like HDS, Kafka, Flume, etc and be processed using complex algorithms expressed with high-level functions like `map`, `reduce`, `join` and `window`. Finally, processed data can be pushed out to filesystems or databases.
